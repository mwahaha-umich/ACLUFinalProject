# ACLUFinalProject

## Background & Purpose
### The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan was established in 1959 to defend civil liberties for every person in the United States. Although their advocacy work spans multiple issues, one of their primary focuses is defending the right to vote. The organization educates Michiganders about their voting rights, encourages them to get involved in the democratic process, and ensures an equal and easy right to vote for every citizen. For our capstone project, we produced an “engagement dashboard” for the ACLU-MI to help them build out their advocacy strategy around voting rights. This dashboard tracks the habits of Michigan voters, volunteer engagement with campaigns, success of initiatives, and more. We also mapped out the locations of voters contacted by the ACLU-MI to help the organization understand who they are and aren’t reaching. The audience of the dashboard includes donors and ACLU-MI employees.

## Getting Started
### We have uploaded a sample of each of the 25 files we have recieved from the ACLU of Michigan which are files on 3 of their Outreach Campaigns in 2020: 
1. Oakland County Prosecutor Race (oakland)
2. Supreme Court of Michigan Race (scomi)
3. Statewide voting rights/voter education race (lpv)

You will need to download all of these .csv files and save them to a folder called "WorkingFiles". 

Next, we have a couple of various external data sources that helped us with this analysis such as geojson files of Michigan, and all registered voters in the state of Michigan by county. These will need to be saved to a folder called "AdditionalFiles". 

You can open the workbooks in Collab, we created a parent folder called "ACLU" to house "WorkingFiles" and "AdditionalFiles" folders. You will need to add your path as shown in the screenshot below:

And then you are good to go to get started!
